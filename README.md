*Interactive notebooks to investigate some topics of deep learning*

## Formula learning

- [Ratio formula learning](ratio_formula_learning.ipynb)

Learn a ratio function `f(x)=(x_1 - x_n)/(x_1 + x_n)` with a fully-connected network and a custom architecture. 
Compare approximated function with theoretical function.
